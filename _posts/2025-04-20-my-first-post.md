# Welcome to my first blog post

This is my first blog post using Jekyll. Jekyll is a static site generator that transforms plain text into beautiful static websites and blogs.

## Features I love about Jekyll

1. **Simple to use**: Write content in Markdown
2. **Fast and secure**: Generates static pages
3. **Version control**: Works great with Git
4. **Customizable**: Easy to modify and extend

```ruby
# Example Ruby code
def hello_world
  puts "Hello, Jekyll!"
end
```

### Getting Started

Jekyll makes it easy to create a website. You can focus on your content while Jekyll handles the rest. Whether you're writing a personal blog, documentation, or a portfolio site, Jekyll has got you covered.

> Jekyll does what you tell it to do â€” no more, no less. It doesn't try to outsmart users by making bold assumptions, nor does it burden them with needless complexity and configuration.
